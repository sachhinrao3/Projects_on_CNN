# Projects_on_CNN
I have build a different projects on the CNN Model in this Repository.

1. **Cifar10 Project:** In this project I have used a Cifar10 dataset from tensorflow.keras datasets and build a CNN model for predicting the classes of images.

I have used 2 ways to build an CNN model, first one by normal approch and in second approach is used a data augmentation technique with the help of ImageDataGenerator and compare the performance for both the cases.
